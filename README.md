# landing-page
Will be creating a landing page based on The Odin Project Curriculum. I am given a blueprint of what the website should look like. I am to recreate the website from scratch using nothing but the knowledge I've learned to this point and a few google searches if needed for some CSS properties I may not have come across yet. I will be adding my own images and a few of my own touches to the website as I create it. But, for the must part the structure of the web page should look almost 1:1! The website will not have much functionalities it will only be used as a reference for design.
